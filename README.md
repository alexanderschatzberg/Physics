# Advanced_Physics

This is where all the code that I write for my 2022-2023 Advanced Physics course is stored. While this is a public repo, it's not meant to be used by anyone else. It's just a place for me to store and share my code.

## Structure

- Folders are named after their topic
- Files in the folders are relavant to the lab/assignment they are for
- The naming system isn't consistent, but it's pretty easy to figure out what's what

## Environment

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- All of my code is written in Python, and I use the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) extension for VS Code
- I use [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) to manage my Python environments and packages. It's like a lighter version of Anaconda that works really well for Apple Silicon Macs.
