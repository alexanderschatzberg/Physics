    "So now you have some understanding of astronomical coordinates, and you know some basics about the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS). However, we have not looked closely at how the location on the sky is encoded into the FITS image and how to utilize this information for your benefit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important transformation that you will want to do is to map a sky coordinate to a pixel coordinate on your image, or vice-versa. For instance, if I gave you the RA and Dec coordinates of a star, you will want to be able to identify which x and y pixel coordinates that sky coordinate corresponds to in your image. This tutorial will focus on that precise task. In the end you will be identifying which star is Tabby's Star in an image provided for you."
