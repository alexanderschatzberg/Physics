    "This tutorial will give you many tools to understand and navigate the basic astronomical coordinates that we use at the Thacher Observatory. Keep in mind that this is only an introduction, and the topic of astronomical coordinates is quite a bit deeper than we will cover here. However, this should give you enough experience to get up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based heavily on a tutorial from http://tutorials.astropy.org in which the `astropy.coordinates` package and related astropy functionality is explored for the purposes of planning observations and other exercises focused on large coordinate catalogs.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Crash Course in Alt-Az Coordinates\n",
    "Altitude-Azimuth, Alt-Az, or horizon coordinates are a longitude-latitude system for locating any position on the sky from **your specific vantage point on Earth.** This last part is emphasized, because the Alt-Az location of something on the sky at a specified time is different for people at different locations. However, the convention is fairly simple and intuitive, particularly if you are familiar with bearings (as most Thacher students are).\n",
    "\n",
    "The azimuth of a source is a degree measured in the easterly direction from North (*e.g.*, zero azimuth is due North, and 90 degrees azimuth is due East). In other words, it is simply the *bearing* of the star.\n",
    "<img src='images/Azimuth-Altitude.png' align='center' width=300px>\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen in the next picture why this coordinate system is tied to your location on earth. The picture shows the altitude-azimuth system that would be used by an observer in the Western US. If you imagine the Alt-Az system used by someone in Brazil, for instance, you can see how the same Alt-Az coordinates in both locations would correspond to two totally different directions in the sky.\n",

    "## Crash Course in Equitorial Coordinates (Right Ascension and Declination)\n",
    "Equitorial coordinates are based on the Earth, and so any observer located anywhere on Earth would be able to find an object on the sky given one set of coordinates. The latitude lines project out into space to create the lines of \"declination.\" Therefore, any celestial object that has a declination equal to your geocentric latitude will reach your local zenith (altitude = 90 degrees) at its highest point. One simple example is to imagine the altitude of the North Star if you were at the North Pole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line of zero declination is called the Celestial Equator and it corresponds to the geocentric equator. The orbit of the Earth around the Sun is not perfectly aligned with the rotation of the Earth. Therefore, the plane of the Solar System creates a line across the sky that does not correspond to the Celestial Equator. This line is called the \"ecliptic,\" and it is offset by approximately 23.5 degrees (see the figure below). The intersections of the celestial equator and the ecliptic define two specific directions in the sky that correspond to the two equinoxes (in Spring and Fall) when the Sun is directly over the Earth's equator.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all quite technical, however, it is important for understanding the longitudinal coordinate of the Equitorial System. It is called \"Right Ascension\" (RA) and there are 24 *hours* of RA in a day. The line of RA = 0 corresponds to the autumnal (or fall) equinox. This is shown in the following diagram... stare at it for a while.\n",
    "<img src='images/RADec_celestial_sphere.png' align='center' width=400px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows how this all bears out in a practical situation. It is a screen shot from the software Stellarium&mdash;which is free and highly recommended for anyone wanting to explore the sky and the different coordinate systems in a hands-on way&mdash;showing a local scene in the northern hemisphere with a light blue grid on the sky that represents the equitorial coordinate system. The lines of declination are separated by 5 degrees.\n",
    "<img src='images/RADec_from_Ground.png' align='center' width=900px>\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your knowledge of what is going on, first identify where the altitude = 0 degrees line would be located. Then identify what celestial object would be located at (or actually, very near) the point where all the lines of longitude converge."
